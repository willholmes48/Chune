## 1. What We Collect

We collect the following information when you use MoodPlayer:

- **Apple Music Data**: We request access to your Apple Music playback, library, and listening history to analyse your musical mood and generate MoodStations.
- **Firebase Data**: We store a unique identifier (`userUid`) and basic usage metadata in Firebase Firestore and use Firebase Authentication for identity management.
- **Subscription Info**: We track your in-app subscription status (via StoreKit and RevenueCat) to determine access to premium features.
- **Mood Interactions**: When you interact with mood refinements or generate playlists, these actions are stored anonymously to improve your experience.

---

## 2. How We Use Your Data

Your data is used to:

- Generate personalised mood-based music recommendations
- Save your MoodStations and refinements
- Track your subscription status and entitlements
- Monitor app performance (e.g. crash reports via Firebase Crashlytics)
- Optionally analyse user inputs using Google GenAI to enhance musical mood insights

We **do not** store or process your full music library, playback activity, or identity outside what’s necessary for functionality.

## 3. Third-Party Services

MoodPlayer uses the following third-party services:

- **Firebase (Google)** – for authentication, analytics, and cloud storage  
- **RevenueCat** – for managing and verifying subscriptions  
- **Apple MusicKit** – to access and play your music library  
- **Google GenAI (via Gemini API)** – to assist with mood logic and playlist generation

These services may process limited data as described in their respective privacy policies.

## 4. Your Rights

As a UK user, under the UK GDPR you have rights including:

- Access to your stored data  
- The right to request deletion of your account  
- The right to object to certain types of data processing

## 5. Data Retention

## 6. Data Security

Your data is stored securely using industry-standard practices on Firebase. No raw Apple Music data is retained beyond what’s needed to generate mood suggestions.
